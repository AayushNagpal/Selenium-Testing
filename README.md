### Tools in Comparison: Selenium, Cucumber, Heleium. 

### Application Under Test: WWW.UNO.EDU

## Research Methodology:


1. Research and select a set of tools to be evaluated
2. Develop a metric suite to be used to evaluate the tools
3. Select target application to be tested
4. Perform a feature assessment for the tools with the goal of ranking the tools based on their features and identifying the 
   ideal feature set for an  optimal tool
5. Test the target applications using the selected automated testing tools and
    gather resulting data
6. Document time spent testing the application and record data
7. Evaluate and interpret results and the tools
8. Draw inferences and make recommendations
